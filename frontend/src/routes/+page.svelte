<h3>Notes from Lisa</h3>
<p>Hi!<br/>
If you want to change the structure of the routing, or want to change a navigational endpoint,<br/>
please change the name of the folder inside the routes folder.<br/><br/>
If you want something like URL/dashboard/resumes/new or whatever,<br/>
please put 'new' as a new folder inside the resumes folder.<br/>
Also please switch to the routing branch.<br/>
Thankies!
